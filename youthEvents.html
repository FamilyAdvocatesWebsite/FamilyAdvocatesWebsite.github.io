	<p>All groups and advocacy are free and confidential. 
	There is a very quick intake process to join each group or advocacy. 
	All Family Advocates, Inc. clients are elligible for each program.</p>

	<h3>Advocacy</h3>
	<p>One-on-one advocacy is a time for the youth to
	meet with a youth advocate, individually. 
	During that time they discuss various topics that the youth, and protective parent, want to talk about. 
	We continue to use art and play therapy techniques through the program A Window Between Worlds.
	Through this program we are able to find art and play activities to help the youth express the traumas they have been through in order to heal. 
	The protective parent is made aware of progress, changes, and/or concerns about the session while maintaining the youth's right to confidentiality.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Youth Group</h3>
	    <p>Family Advocates, Inc. Youth Group is on Monday nights from 5:00pm-7:00pm
	
	    We provide a home cooked meal from 5:00pm-5:30pm for all participants
	
	    After the meal the adults and youth separate for the remainder of the group
	
	    dependent on volunteers the youth group is split up into three different groups:
	
	    Infant & Toddlers,
	
	    Adolescents, and
	
	    Teens.
	
	    All groups have an art and embodied art component that gives every youth the opportunity to express themselves.
	
	    The youth have oppotunities to share what the projects make them feel.
	
	    The last group of every month is a Together Day where the youth and women have 3 different break out sessions that incorporate play, art, and discussion.</p>

	<h3>After School Tutoring</h3>
	    <p>Our after school tutoring program is called Kids In Transition (KIT). With transitioning meaning from homelessness to residency. Statistics have proven that youth who become homeless drop between one to two letter grades.
	
	
	
	    Our goal is to have a one-on-one tutoring session with a volunteer and youth with the hope that meeting with tutors twice a week students will maintain and improve their grades.
	
	
	
	    All students are picked up from school and are brought to a single location. 
	    There they receive a snack and time to read. After reading they meet with their tutors to complete their homework. 
	    If the student completes all of their homework before the end of KIT then they play games with their tutor until everyone has completed their homework.</p>

	<h3>Summer Day Camp</h3>
	    <p>All Grant County clients will be eligible for the Summer Day Camp. We host a wide array of events from swimming to hiking 
	    "The M" to waterballoon games to  art activities to drip drip splash. Times and dates vary. 
	    For more information call the Youth Services Coordinator at the Grant County Office.</p>
