		<h2 id=What_is_it>What is Sexual Assault?</h2>
		<h6 class="listMain">Sexual Assault:</h6>
		<ul class="listMain">
			<li>Is a criminal act of power. According to Wisconsin law, sexual assault is "any intentional act of sexual contact or sexual intercourse accomplished without the consent of one of the persons."</li>
			<li>Includes incest, rape, acquaintance and date rape, marital rape, child sexual assault, exposure, sexual harassment and voyeurism.</li>
			<li>Is everyone's problem. It can happen to anyone, at any time, at any place.</li>
			<li>Can happen to people of any age, sex, race, income level, sexual orientation or physical ability. The majority of sexual assault survivors are assaulted by someone they know.</li>
			<li>Uses a threat of force, control, manipulation, violence, or sex as a weapon. It can be a physical or verbal act, which breaks a person's security and trust.</li>
			<li>May include incest. Incest is a betrayal of trust involving sexual activity between people who are related or are perceived to be related. This may include abuse, intercourse, verbal seduction, objectification, sodomy, direct or implied threats or touching.</li>
			<li>You are not to blame. You are not alone. Help is available.</li>

		<img src="./assets/images/sexual_assault_awareness.jpg" title="SAS" class="centerFit" style="float:right; padding-left:10px;"/>
		<p class="listMain">Sexual assault is neither "asked for" nor deserved. "Giving in" to sexual activity is not the same as consenting. Do what you must to survive.</p>
		<ul class="listMain">
            <li>Scream as loudly and deeply as you can. This may startle the attacker long enough for you to get away.</li>
            <li>Buy time with talk. Conversing will distract the attacker while you plan an escape.</li>
            <li>If you choose to defend yourself, attack and make it count. Choose your movement carefully; then, attack quickly and aggressively.</li>
            <li>Strike at the vulnerable areas. Go for the eyes, nose, throat, groin and knees.</li>
            <li>Try to remember as many details as possible about the attacker and the attack.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="listMain">A victim is <strong>NEVER</strong> responsible for an assault. Do not blame yourself for being assaulted.</p>
		<ul class="listMain">		
            <li>Go immediately to a safe place. Try not to damage potential evidence. Do not bathe, wash, shower, douse, change or discard clothes. Seek medical attention.</li>
            <li>Strongly consider reporting the assault to the police. This should be done immediately so a medical evidence collection exam can be completed.</li>
            <li>Strongly consider making contact with Family Advocates' Sexual Assault Services. We can assist you with information, support, counseling, and advocacy whether or not you call the police. Any contact with an advocate is completely confidential.</li>
